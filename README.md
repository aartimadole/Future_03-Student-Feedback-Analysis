# 🎓 College Event Feedback Analysis  
**Data Science & Analytics Task 3 – By Future Interns**

✨ This project analyzes student feedback from college events (workshops, seminars, tech fests, and cultural nights) using **Python in Google Colab**.  
The dataset includes **ratings (1–5 scale)** and **feedback comments** collected via Google Forms.  

With tools like **pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, TextBlob, VADER, and WordCloud**, the notebook cleans, analyzes, and visualizes survey responses to uncover insights and provide recommendations for better event planning.

## 🔍 Project Overview
Colleges collect feedback after events, but it often goes unused. This project demonstrates how to turn raw feedback into **actionable insights** with data science techniques.  

**Objectives:**
- Analyze satisfaction ratings
- Perform sentiment analysis on comments
- Visualize trends with charts and word clouds
- Recommend improvements for organizers

---

## 🧠 Skills Learned
- Data cleaning & manipulation with **pandas**  
- **Sentiment analysis** using TextBlob & VADER  
- Visualization with **matplotlib & seaborn**  
- Word cloud generation for common themes  
- Interpreting survey data into insights  

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Google Colab** – No setup required  
- **pandas** – Data cleaning & preparation  
- **matplotlib / seaborn** – Visualizations  
- **TextBlob / VADER** – Sentiment analysis  
- **WordCloud** – Feedback visualization  

---

## 📂 Dataset
- Export survey responses from **Google Forms** as CSV  
- Or use the included `students_feedback.csv` (dummy dataset with events, ratings, and comments)  

---

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Open [Google Colab]https://colab.research.google.com/drive  
2. Upload the notebook `College_Event_Feedback_Analysis.ipynb`  
3. Upload your **Google Form CSV** when prompted  
4. Run all cells to see results

## 📊 Example Outputs
- **Rating Distribution** (bar chart)  
- **Sentiment Analysis** (pie & bar charts)  
- **Word Cloud** of common feedback terms  
- **Insights**: Top-rated events, department performance, satisfaction trends  

---

## 📁 Deliverables
- Jupyter Notebook / Colab link with clean, commented code  
- Visual report including charts, sentiment summary, and recommendations  

---

## 📌 Example Insights
- ⭐ Tech Fest scored the highest average rating  
- 🚫 Students often mention “too crowded” in feedback  
- 🏆 CSE events received the most positive sentiment  
- 📉 Workshops need more hands-on practice  

---

## 🎯 Future Scope
- Add topic modeling (LDA) for deeper text analysis  
- Build interactive dashboards (Streamlit / Power BI)  
- Automate Google Form → Colab pipeline
